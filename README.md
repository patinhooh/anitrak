## Project Overview 🎡

The AniList CLI Project is a command-line tool built in Go for tracking anime viewing progress by interacting with the AniList API. The primary goal of this project is to learn Go programming concepts while building a practical application.

### Goals ⭐

- Develop a simple yet powerful CLI tool for anime tracking.
- Practice working with APIs using modern communication protocols.
- Enhance skills in Go programming.

### Plans 📝

- Enable full functionality to manage anime/manga tracking via the CLI, including:
  - Searching for anime by title, ID, or using filters and sorting options similar to the AniList website
  - Viewing detailed information about anime
  - Tracking watch status (planned, watching, completed, dropped)
  - Adding or removing anime from lists
  - Viewing user statistics
  - Updating episode progress
  - Managing custom lists and tags
  - Supporting user authentication for personalized data access
  - Caching results to minimize API calls
